# SpamTheScam
A script to spam scammers with - (Formally known as ScamTheScam)

It's an odd name, but hear this out.

I work in Computer I.T. and I see very often that scammers like to trick employees into entering their email address and password into a webform disguised as geniune by sending enticing phishing emails with links to the users.

If you know how to capture the form data from the HTTP headers being sent to the these scammers, you can plug it into the Python script and have it send tens of thousands of fake usernames and passwords to the scammers.

Depending on how they have their system set up, you will potentially flood their collection inbox with so many fake credentials, any real ones will be burried. This not only messes with these scammers, but should theorectically protect those who have fallen prey to thei scam.
